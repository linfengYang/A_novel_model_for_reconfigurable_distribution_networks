# A_novel_model_for_reconfigurable_distribution_networks
This project provides examples of all the models and data used in the paper "Distributionally robust scheduling with CVaR assessment for reconfigurable distribution networks hosting renewable energy penetrations"ã€‚

Dada: Contains all the data used in the model, taken from the IEEE example system and real data.

SO_and_RO_model: Source code of robust and stochastic optimization models.

DR_CVaR_models: Source code of distributionally robust optimization model with CVaR assessment.
